## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- Uses Supabase Auth (email / magic link)
- Each user is assigned a unique user_id
- All database tables enforce Row Level Security
- Users can only access their own reports and summaries
- No service-role keys are exposed to the client

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

1. Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/reportbrief.git
  cd reportbrief
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

3. Create environment variables

Create a .env.local file in the project root:

```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_optional
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## 🧪 AI Behavior (MVP Phase)

During early development:

- AI responses are stubbed if no OpenAI key is present
- This allows full UI + data-flow testing at $0 cost

The OpenAI integration can be enabled later without refactoring.

### 📌 Roadmap

- Secure authentication
- CSV upload & parsing
- AI summary stub
- OpenAI production prompts
- Dashboard UX polish
- Stripe subscriptions
- Team / org support
- Salesforce direct API integration

## 🧠 Product Vision

ReportBrief aims to be:

>  “The fastest way to understand what your Salesforce reports are actually saying.”

Long-term plans include:

- Multiple report types
- Scheduled summaries
- Slack / email delivery
- Org-wide insights
